**Author :** RÃ©mi Pelletier  
**Description :** Simple cross-platform sockets wrapper (Work in progress). 
  
## Notice  

This project is not currently finished, it may contain errors, bugs and inaccuracies. The source code was published at this state in order to showcase the progress I have made on this project. Every file on the repository is therefore subject to change.

The project currently only supports Winsock sockets, support for the Linux and OSX implementations of POSIX sockets will be coming shortly.

The current implementation uses an abstract class and factory pattern, it might be replaced by a Pointer to implementation (PIMPL) pattern.
